<p><h3>You have no idea how long this few second GIF took to finish. I mean... there are THREE versions of the one you're currently seeing, but they're all messed up. This one in particular is the refined one. I had to go frame by frame, layer by layer to find where the kinks and bullsh*t was. My god it was a pain in the ass. In truth, this GIF is actually missing a part. The frame where it's showing the hand on the weapon just before it fires, the finger is suppose to go backwards to mimick a pull of the trigger, but the layers were so disorginized that I couldn't figure out where the layer needed to be in order for the GIF to run smoothly. SOOO I settled with not having a trigger pull but a muzzle flare.
